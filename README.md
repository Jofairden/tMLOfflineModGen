# tMLOfflineModGen
A mod skeleton generator for tModLoader that does not require a browser or an internet connection.

## Features
All the functionality that the normal mod skeleton generator has, plus the option to choose the language version and to 
specify your .gitignore files.

## Usage and installation
Extremely simple! Just download the jar file from the releases and run it. Make sure you have Java installed.
Fill in the fields provided (you don't have to fill in languageVersion or build ignore files), and the installer will generate a new
folder at the specified directory containing all your mod files.
